# EXPERIMENT 6
# Decision making statements and loops:
## Introduction:
This experiment focuses on implementing various decision-making statements and loops in C++. Each program demonstrates a unique aspect of control flow, including if-else, while, do-while, and nested loops.  
## Programs Overview:
## Program 1: while loop from 1 to 20:
## logic :
This program uses a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 20. It demonstrates the basic structure of a while loop, where the condition is checked before executing the loop body.  
## Program 2: Do while loop example:  
## Logic:  
This program illustrates the use of a do-while loop. Unlike a while loop, a do-while loop guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once before the condition is checked.  
## Program 3: Flipped Floyds traingle:
## Logic :  
This program generates a flipped version of Floyd's Triangle using nested loops. It uses for loops to print a pattern of numbers in a triangular format, starting with the maximum width and reducing it in each subsequent row.  
## Prgram 4: Floyds Triangle:
## Logic:
This program constructs Floyd's Triangle using nested for loops. The numbers are printed in a right-angled triangular format, starting from 1 at the top and continuing sequentially.   
## Program 5: Password Check with While Loop
Logic:
This program prompts the user to enter a password and uses a while loop to keep asking for input until the correct password is entered. It demonstrates how loops can be used for validation purposes.  

## Program 6: Reverse Star Pattern
## Logic:
This program prints a reverse star pattern, decreasing the number of stars in each row. It uses nested loops to control the number of stars printed and the number of rows.  

## Program 7: Star Pattern
## Logic:
This program creates a basic star pattern with a fixed number of rows and columns using nested loops. It's a simple example of using loops to generate patterns.  

## Program 8: Star Pyramid
## Logic:
This program generates a star pyramid with a center alignment. It uses nested loops where the outer loop controls the rows, and the inner loops manage spaces and star printing for each row.  

These programs are a great way to understand the practical application of loops and decision-making statements in C++. Explore each program to get a deeper insight into how control structures work in real-world scenarios
